          <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
          <p>
            With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
            below, users and data subjects have the right
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
              processed, information about the data being processed, further
              information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of
              the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
              16 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art.
              17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary
              as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
              per Art. 18 GDPR;
            </li>
            <li>
              to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
              them and to have the same transmitted to other
              providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
            </li>
            <li>
              to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
              that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
              breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
            whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
            restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1,
            18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such
            notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.
            Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
            recipients.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the
              right to object to the controller’s future processing of their
              data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an
              objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising
              is permissible.</strong

          <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
          <p>
            Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or
            blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply,
            provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory
            storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

            Customer account/registration
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will
            use the data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your
            address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading up
            to your potential placement of an order or entering some other
            contractual relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or
            contracts, and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an
            overview of your previous orders or to be able to offer you a
            wishlist function). We also store your IP address and the date and
            time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to
            third parties.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for
            this processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy
            policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide
            your customer account.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a)
            GDPR is the legal basis for this processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to
            the initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill
            an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is
            also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal
            data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All
            you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as
            processing is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any
            retention periods required under tax and commercial law.
          </p>
          <h4 class="jet-listing-dynamic-field__content">Server data</h4>
          <p>
            For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
            browser to us or to our server provider will be collected,
            especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log
            files record the type and version of your browser, operating system,
            the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our
            site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP
            address from which you visited our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
            association with any other of your data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
            legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability,
            functionality, and security of our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
            continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which
            case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until
            the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
